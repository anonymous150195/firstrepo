PSEUDOCODE  -   Pseudocode is a detailed yet readable description of what a computer program or algorithm should do. It is written in a formal yet
                readable style that uses a natural syntax and formatting so it can be easily
                understood by programmers and others involved in the development process.

DRY RUN     -    A dry run is the process of a programmer manually working through their code to trace the value of variables. 

MODULUS OPERATOR   -  The modulus operator, sometimes also called the remainder operator or integer remainder operator works on integers (and integer expressions) 
                      and yields the remainder when the first operand is divided by the second.
                      In Python, the modulus operator is a percent sign ( % ). The syntax is the same as for other operators.

 DATA TYPES       -    Char,int,float,boolean

 ARRAY           -  Continuous memory allocation.Array index starts from zero.
